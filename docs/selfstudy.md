## Positional Lag Introduced by Distance Averaging

## Effects of Beacon Orientation on Signal Strength

## RSSI Adjustment

Although initial experiments showed that the beacons had noticably varying
signal strength, those differences were apparently caused by my laptop's
Bluetooth sensor and not the beacons.

As per experimentation documented [here](documentation.md#data), each
beacon was configured to advertise an RSSI of -61 dBm at 1 meter away.

## Latency Introduced by MQTT Broker
